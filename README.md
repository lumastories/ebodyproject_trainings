## Dot probe

 - [X] There is a typo in the instructions (That was in the text I sent to you, sorry).  Can you please take out the word “was” in this line:  “Your job is to press the "c" if the dot appears behind the left photograph was or "m" if the dot appears behind the right photograph.”
 - [X] Between blocks it says the number correct, can we please add out of how many?
 - [X] Between blocks where it says the reaction time, can we add “ms”?
 - [X] The dot is slightly off center, would it be possible to center it in the boxes?  (That’s nit-picky.  If this is going to take too much time, don’t worry about it).
 - [X] Can you add a line of code that prevents the same photos from coming up multiple times in the same block?

## Go/no go

 - [X] In the instructions, can we please add “Press any key to begin.”
 - [X] Between blocks it says the number correct, can we please add out of how many?
 - [X] Between blocks where it says the reaction time, can we add “ms” so they know what the units are?
 - [X] Between blocks can we please add “Press any key to continue.”

## Visual search

 - [X] Can you add a line of code that prevents the same photos from being the target multiple times in the same block?
 - [X] Between blocks it says the number correct, can we please add out of how many?
 - [X] If you click on multiple photos, the program will quickly flip through multiple arrays.  Would it be possible to record only one response (the first response) for each trial?  Presumably, the participants won’t be clicking multiple photos often but if someone changes their mind last second and tries to click another photo it would be nice if the program didn’t skip an array.
 - [X] The photos are really small.  Can we make the arrays 5 across by 3 down and make the photos larger?  Or if you have better ideal as how we can make the photos larger, I’m open to hear it.  Eric does not want participants to have to scroll to make a response..
