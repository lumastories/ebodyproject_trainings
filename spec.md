| Go/no-go | Pictures of models appear to the left or righ side of a rectangle for 1250 ms. On half the trials the rectangular frome is not solid, but hatched, which is a signal for them to withhold their response. Each of the 80 average-weight women images and 80 ultra-thin women images are randomly selected. Ultra-thin women are always paired with inhibition signals whereas average-weight eomen are never paired with inhibition signals. | Participants are asked to respond as quickly as possible. c/m indicates if the photo is on left/right side. Responses only made when the photo is in a solid rectangle | If the partcipant responds incorrectly (indicates the wrong side or responds to a photo in the hatched border) or if they do not make any response during the 1250 ms a red X will appear in the center of the screen for 500 ms. | Blank screen for 500 ms, no fixation cross | 300 total | 6 blocks (50 trials per block) |
| Dot probe | Each of the 80 average-weight women images will be randomly paired with one of the 80 ultra-thin women images (side by side) for 500 ms. Immediately Immediately after the images disappear, a small dot probe appears in the location of one of the images. The probe appears in the location occupied by an ultra-thin woman 10% of the time and in the location occupied by an average weight woman 90% of the time | Participants are asked to respond as quickly as possible. c/m indicates if the dot is on left/right side. Dot remains until a response is made | They do not receive feedback. As soon as a response is made, the paradigm moves to the next fixation cross | Each trial is preceded by a fixation cross for 500 ms | 320 trials: Each of the 80 picture pairs will be presented 4 times, with each picture presented twice on each side of the screen. | 8 blocks (40 trials per block) |
| Visual search | Participants will search for one average weight woman in a 4x4 array of ultra thin women, clicking on the average weight woman as quickly as possible. Photos will be randomly selected with no image appearing in the same array twice. Each average weight woman should be a target at least once. | Mouse click-paradigm does not continue until a response is made | If participant responds correctly, the average weight woman photo is framed in green and zooms toward them, while the ultra thin women images images zoom away (1000 ms). For incorrect responses, all images zoom away and a red X appears over the images (1000 ms). | Each trial is preceded by a fixation cross for 500 ms | 120 trials | 4 blocks (30 arrays per block) |
